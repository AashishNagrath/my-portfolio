        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a hardworking and driven Computer Science student with a clear vision for my professional future. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA), which I completed in 2024, achieving a commendable CGPA of 8.75. Building on this solid base, I am now focused on specialized learning through my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) in Software Engineering. I'm highly proficient in several key Object-Oriented Programming languages, namely Python, Java, and C++, and I'm eager to apply these skills in real-world scenarios. My primary career interests lie in software development, game development, and software testing, areas where I believe I can make significant contributions. Furthermore, my experience with video editing software such as Da Vinci Resolve and Wondershare Filmora showcases my ability to learn new technologies and adapt to diverse creative challenges.
